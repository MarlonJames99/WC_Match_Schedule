## Other aspects:
This project was developed in Mobile first, and I used a media querie to adapt the page correctly to bigger screens.

## Next steps:
> I have planned to implement in this application improvements related to accessibility, as it is very important that it can be used properly by everyone! <br><br>
> It's missing the Favicon image.
